Sorry! Your proposal did not pass. 

Thank you for submitting your challenge, however, 
upon reviewing your blueprint it does not contain the necessary functions to serve as an escrow. 

As the challenge mentions: “A very common operation you can find in traditional and decentralized finance 
is the need for two parties to exchange assets with each other.” For example, in the case of the escrow blueprint we have:     

1. User A instantiates the escrow by requesting 100 XRD and offering one NFT (but can also offer any fungible resource)   

2. User A can cancel the escrow at any time and get their 1 NFT back.    

3. User B wants the NFT and has 100 XRD, then uses the swap function with a deposit with 100 XRD.    

4. If the escrow is still active, user B gets 1 NFT    

5. User A can use the withdraw_resource function to get the 100 XRD.

We suggest you check out our escrow model, because it contains useful information with the minimum methods 
required to have a viable escrow. 

Because the blueprint is not complete, you were also unable 
to submit the other component addresses for question 3 and the other transaction manifests required in question 4.

Please update your submission and try again! 

Happy coding!
